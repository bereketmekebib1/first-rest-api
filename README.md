# First REST API Spring Boot Application

## Description
This project is a backend REST API created using Java and Spring Boot.
The application allows users to manage a simple product catalogue by performing basic CRUD operations, create, read, update, and delete products.

For data storage, the project uses an H2 in-memory database, which means the data is stored only while the application is running. This makes it very useful for development, testing, and learning purposes, without the need to configure an external database.

The project also includes Swagger UI, which is used to document and test the API endpoints. Using Swagger, all HTTP methods can be tested directly from the browser in a clear and easy way
